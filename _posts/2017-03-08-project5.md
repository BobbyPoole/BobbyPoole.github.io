While it would be very easy to make a boat related pun or even a joke related to the Oscar winning film, I'll take the high road on this and just let a sleeping dog lie. Essenentially that ship has sailed.

So I've been working on a data set utilizing the data of the passengers on Titanic to try to find out if their were any variables that led to certain passengers surviving over others. From my inital readings of the Titanic, my expectations were to find that women and children would have the higher chances of surviving since that was who the crew prioritized to put on lifeboats first.

Going through the data while I was not suprised by how many more men there were on the ship then women (again it's 1912 a time where women still couldn't vote in the United States) I was surprised by the discrepancy in ages. If you look at the histogram at the bottom, you'll notice how in essentially every age group men clearly outnumber women. Additionally, there is a massive amount of men clustered around the 30 year old mark where as the highest cluster of women occur at just below the 20 year old mark. It shows not only how much men outnumber women, but also how the ages of both groups are not close to each other.

Additionally, I was curious to see what age ranges were most and least likely to be saved, on the next histogram, we see that there are fairly good survival rates for those who were under 20 (primarily children). Probably the most interesting part of the chart that I saw was around the 30 year age mark. We see that while nearly 140 people died in that age range, just over 40 were saved. This is much starker than that of the survival rate of the children. This also brings me back to the earlier chart. I made a note before that the men were heavily stacked around that 30 year old mark. So, who do you think were the casualties for that age range. Yup you got it, men. Finally, while there weren't too many older individuals on the Titanic, it is interesting to see how the survival rate is minimal once age is past 65.

Finally, in doing a logistic regression, we were able to make a strong prediction on whether someone would survive or not based on their age, what they paid, title and sex among other factors. We ultimately ended up having an ROC area of .88 which is a strong indicator of accurate predictions. I was excited about the fact that there were fairly strong scores in how precise our predictions were about whether or not the person survived with a rate of about .83 but I was most happy to see that the rate was showing that we were doing a good job of predicting who survived the Titanic.

For the penultimate project, I looked at the top 250 IMDB movies based on their rating on the IMDB website. For this project, I looked at how factos such as year, number of reviews, genre and other elements had a contribution in determining the rating of the movie.

The first thing that I did was scrape the IMDB website for the information. One of the most important things that I found in going through my second scrape was learning from my mistakes from the previous webscraping challenge. LIke with anything, it takes practice to be able to execute the code needed to extract information off of the IMDB page. Afterwards, I started setting up the dataframe in order to do my analysis.

I then dummified the genre, month, key words, and country the movie was filmed in order to get a better gauge on whether each element was present or not when looking at a specific film. 

One of the more interesting findings was the number of votes that each movie recieved. On the chart below, you can see the distribution of votes for each given movie eas heavily distributed below the 250,000 vote threshold. While a lot of the movies have a ton of votes, it is generally hard to see how many votes the ones lower down on the chart ended up with.

Finally, I ran my decision tree and random forest model in order to see if each it could predict whether or not each movie was above below the median threshold of a film. Ultimately, it had about a 68% accuracy. My takeaway was that while there were certainly more elements I would like to look at when doing this project again like actos, director and rating. Having fewer features definitely allowed me to have an achievable model with a reasonable accuracy rate.
